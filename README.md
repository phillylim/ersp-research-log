Tuesday (1.5 hours) for log set up and reflection
Set up a log. I chose to use Google Docs/Notion for my first log because currently it is the easiest option; however, I plan on potentially pivoting over to using GitHub for my logs.
Wrote log reflection
This is what I am most excited about in ERSP:
I’m excited to learn about the whole process that goes behind research, while learning key skills to help me conduct research. I’m incredibly excited to work with other people towards this research project as well and to try to get published!
This is what I am most nervous about in ERSP:
I’m nervous about not having all the skills to excel at research–however, I do acknowledge ERSP is also a place to learn. I’m also nervous about potentially not having a “good enough” paper to publish–and to that end, also not having a “good enough” proposal. I’m also somewhat worried about not having all the foundational knowledge, similar to skills, in core subjects in our research project, and I want to as soon as possible supplement my learning with auditing courses.
